# 023-rtlnumberofsetbits-tgl — **UNPROVEN** (forked 2026-09-20)

Microarchitecture variant of [`023-rtlnumberofsetbits`](../023-rtlnumberofsetbits/). Proved on: bench #3 -- Intel Core i9-11900H (Tiger Lake-H / Willow Cove); see docs/PLATFORM-i9-11900H.md

> **Status: UNPROVEN.** This directory was created by `tools/new-variant.py` and its `impl.asm` is
> still a byte-for-byte copy of the parent's. It has not been measured. Do not cite a number from
> here until this header is replaced by a real results table.

## Why this fork exists

ntdll's large-bitmap path and our scalar POPCNT loop tie on Zen 3 at 1 Mb (1.00x). On Willow Cove the same loop measures 0.74x: POPCNT is one per cycle with a serialising accumulator chain, and this machine has AVX512VPOPCNTDQ, which ntdll cannot use because it must also run on parts that lack it. The variant counts 512 bits per instruction with two independent accumulators.

The parent change was **not edited**, deliberately. Its `RESULTS.md` records a measurement taken on
a different machine against a different microarchitecture, and editing the implementation it
describes would silently re-attribute that measurement to hardware that never ran it. Both versions
live in the repository; the sweep runs both; each says which bench proved it.

## What is shared with the parent, and why

`reference.c` (the oracle), `correctness.c` (the gate, which also resolves the **live** system
export via `GetProcAddress`) and `bench.c` are byte-for-byte copies. This is not laziness — it is
the only way the two results are comparable. A variant graded by a different correctness harness
than its parent has proven nothing about the parent.

Files copied: `bench.c`, `build.bat`, `correctness.c`, `impl.asm`, `reference.c`

## Procedure

1. Run `build.bat` **before touching `impl.asm`** and confirm it reproduces the parent's behaviour
   on this machine. A variant never observed passing is a variant whose first failure cannot be
   attributed.
2. Change `impl.asm` only.
3. Re-run. The gate is unchanged: **correct against the live export, and no size class regresses.**
4. Replace this header with the real table — correctness corpus counts, the per-size-class
   benchmark, the ISA used and its dispatch story, and a one-line verdict LANDED or PARKED.
